# FSO_Link_alignment_system

The project Free space optics link alignment system is a line-of-sight technology which is an optical communication using laser and that can transfer data in both air and vacuum. The system does not require any cables or any spectrum licence. Which led us to implement a small-scale model of the communication.  		   
The methodology of the system design was to be implemented using Arduino and sensors that replicate the working of the system in small scale. The tools used in this implementation were stepper motor and laser and LDR sensors. 						     
The important conclusions I took from the implementation of the project were that this communication system is a very efficient and can be implemented anywhere to establish a high-speed point to point communication.
